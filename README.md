# Introduction
With the jaw-dropping but not surprising fact that the average time a recruiter puts their eyes on one resume is 7 seconds, picking experiences/projects to put into a resume, with page limit (usually one), is critical and vary from job to job.
For example, my AI project experience won't fit in a full stack engineer job. I usually spent so much unecessary time to refactor my resume by copying, pasting and time-consuming format adjusting etc.
With this resume maker, I can build new resume within 1 minite (with existing data of course). That's handy. And it's highly scalable that you can add new section(s) to your resume without changing my code.
